# Steam Key Activator

### What does it do?
This program allows you to enter in any number of keys into Steam (as long as they work)
and will activate them for you while you go do something else.

***DO BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE!!***

	1. Make sure Python 3 is installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
	2. Make sure Python is added as an ENV path during install
	3. Run the 'pyautogui-Install.bat' file as an admin before using the program (only required once)
	4. Fill the 'keys.txt' file with all of your keys on new lines
